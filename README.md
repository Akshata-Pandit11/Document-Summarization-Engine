# Document-Summarization-Engine
This project implements a hybrid PDF text summarizer that combines extractive summarization using TextRank (Sumy) and abstractive summarization using Hugging Face Transformers. It allows users to upload PDF documents, extract the content, and get concise summaries using both classical and modern NLP methods.
